Hey everyone on my GitHub profile! I'm JarzaClay, a new GitHub user who was into scratch for the longest time, and I'm now moving on to computer coding languages like C++, Java, and Javascript! If you're interested in collaborating with me, I'm kind of busy right now, but new collaborations would be amazing in the future! I'm soon to be a Twitch streamer, and you can find me at https://bit.ly/jarzalivetwitch. My main goal on GitHub is to create a new antivirus for computers. I enjoy watching YouTube, and have a few friends! I am an intense gamer, and I enjoy minecraft server like mc.hypixel.net!
